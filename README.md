# About
This is a python platformer game that I decided to make. It only has three levels, but I might add more in the future. The aim of the game is to make a frog complete an obstacle course whilst collecting coins. The player can use WASD keys as well as arrow keys. The player also has to avoid the enemies (a mouse and three bees) that appear in levels two and three.
